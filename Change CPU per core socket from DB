### Change CPU per core socket from DB

1. Shutdown the VM 
2. Delete the 'platform' row for this VM ID in user_vm_details i.e (delete from user_vm_details where id = XXXX;) 
>>3. Create a cpu.corespersocket entry for this VM ID in user_vm_details table using the below MySQL query.

Query:
mysql> insert into user_vm_details (vm_id,name,value,display) values (<vmid>,"cpu.corespersocket",<cps>,1);
Note: Replace <vmid> with the id of the VM and <cps> with the desired core per socket value.

4. Boot the VM from CS. 
5. The 'platform' row is rebuilt from XS.
